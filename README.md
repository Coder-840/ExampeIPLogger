# Example IP Logger
---
##### This is a simple IP logger that can be deployed on services like Railway. I don't know why I made this. I just kind of got curious how hackers stole your IP I guess. However, this quickly escelated to a full on project. Set your key, your password, and deploy! Once you deploy, go to the /dashboard path/directory, enter your set password, and see your admin panel! From there, anyone that visits your site, enters a username, and presses go, will be shown the flashing red screen. From the admin panel, you will be able to see their IP, Language, User-Agent, Browser Timezone, and even if they are using a VPN!
